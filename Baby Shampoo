<p style="line-height:normal;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-size:12.0pt;"><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">Fire sprinklers are crucial safety devices designed to suppress or extinguish fires in buildings. Comprising a network of pipes and nozzles connected to a water supply, sprinklers activate when exposed to high temperatures, releasing water to control the fire and prevent its spread. These devices are strategically installed in various areas to provide comprehensive coverage and rapid response, minimizing property damage and enhancing occupant safety. The manufacturing process of fire sprinklers involves precision engineering and quality materials. Typically made from durable metals such as brass or corrosion-resistant alloys, the sprinkler components are meticulously crafted to meet industry standards. The assembly includes a heat-sensitive element, often a glass bulb filled with a heat-sensitive liquid, which ruptures when exposed to fire-generated heat, triggering the sprinkler system. Rigorous testing ensures reliability, and the finished sprinklers are then distributed for installation in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.</span></span></p>
